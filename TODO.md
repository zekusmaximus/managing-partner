# Managing Partner - Project Status

## Current State

Managing Partner is a playable single-browser prototype. The dashboard, five-tab finances view, HR, clients, inbox, 34-step tutorial, and help glossary are implemented. The first stabilization pass corrected identified simulation and reporting defects, added a versioned local save and New Game reset, and made the shared layout usable on desktop and mobile. There is no account, backend, or cross-device sync.

The earlier 15–20% completion estimate and checklist described work that has since been built. Progress toward a finished game cannot be stated as a precise percentage without defining the intended feature set.

## Completed in the Stabilization Pass

- [x] Extract testable simulation transitions, inbox decisions, and P&L metrics.
- [x] Target inbox decisions to named subjects and prevent repeat actions.
- [x] Validate finite monetary inputs; correct quarter opening actuals, reallocations, margin, write-offs, and historic category totals.
- [x] Save simulation and tutorial together after hydration; restore dates; validate corrupt saves; provide confirmed New Game.
- [x] Use one responsive app shell, reachable mobile month controls, alert navigation, accessible help and inbox buttons, and a chart legend.
- [x] Align tutorial examples and spotlight actions with the displayed model and navigation.
- [x] Add focused simulation and save tests.

## Next Work

- [ ] Decide on the longer-term accounting rules for client-level receivables, accruals, credit-line transactions, and partner distributions. The current model remains intentionally simplified.
- [ ] Expand scenario variety and balancing after observing play sessions.
- [ ] Add a documented save export/import or account sync only if play across browsers or devices becomes a requirement.
- [ ] Run usability sessions with new players and refine tutorial length, labels, and decision feedback.

## Quality Gate

Run `bun test`, `bun typecheck`, `bun lint`, and `bun run build` before committing. Walk through all five routes and the tutorial at 390, 768, 1280, and 1440px, including keyboard navigation.
